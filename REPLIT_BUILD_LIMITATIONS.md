# Replit Build Limitations for App Store Connect

## Current Issue
Building React Native apps for App Store Connect requires:
1. Apple Developer Account authentication
2. EAS CLI installation and login
3. Extended build times (often 20-30 minutes)
4. Stable internet connection throughout the build process

## Replit Environment Limitations
- **Timeout Issues**: EAS CLI installation times out due to Replit's execution limits
- **Authentication**: Cannot maintain persistent Apple Developer login sessions
- **Build Duration**: App Store builds exceed Replit's command timeout limits
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited memory and processing power for complex builds

## Recommended Solution: Local Development

### Step 1: Download Project Files
1. In Replit, click the three dots menu (⋮) in the top-right corner
2. Select "Download as ZIP"
3. Extract the ZIP file on your local machine
4. Navigate to the `tracklit-native` folder

### Step 2: Local Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd tracklit-native
npm install

# Install required CLI tools
npm install -g @expo/cli eas-cli

# Login to Expo (requires Apple Developer Account)
eas login
```

### Step 3: Configure Apple Developer Settings
1. Edit `eas.json` and replace placeholders:
   - `YOUR_APPLE_ID_HERE` → Your Apple Developer email
   - `YOUR_APP_STORE_CONNECT_ID_HERE` → Your App Store Connect app ID

### Step 4: Build for TestFlight
```bash
# Interactive build script
./build-testflight.sh

# Or build directly
eas build --platform ios --profile testflight
```

### Step 5: Submit to App Store Connect
```bash
# After successful build
eas submit --platform ios --profile production
```

## Alternative: GitHub Actions (Recommended for CI/CD)
Set up automated builds using GitHub Actions with EAS secrets configured in your repository settings.

## Project Status
✅ **Ready for Local Build**: All configuration files are properly set up
✅ **TestFlight Configuration**: Complete with bundle ID com.tracklit.app
✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides available
❌ **Replit Build**: Not feasible due to environment limitations

## Next Steps
1. Download the project files from Replit
2. Set up local development environment
3. Configure Apple Developer credentials
4. Run local TestFlight build
5. Submit to App Store Connect

The React Native app is fully configured and ready for TestFlight deployment once moved to a local environment.
