# TrackLit App Store Connect - Immediate Next Steps

## Current Status: Authentication Required

The React Native app is **100% configured and ready for App Store Connect**, but requires Apple Developer account authentication that cannot be completed in the Replit environment.

## Why Authentication is Required

App Store Connect submissions require:
- Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year)
- Valid signing certificates
- App Store Connect app registration
- EAS CLI authentication with Apple ID

## Ready-to-Use Configuration

### âœ… Complete App Configuration:
- **Bundle ID**: `com.tracklit.app`
- **Version**: 1.0.0 with auto-incrementing builds
- **App Icons**: All iOS sizes configured
- **Permissions**: Camera, microphone, location properly set
- **Build Profiles**: TestFlight and production ready

### âœ… All Required Files:
- `app.json` - Complete Expo configuration
- `eas.json` - EAS Build configuration
- `package.json` - All dependencies configured
- `build-testflight.sh` - Automated build script
- All React Native source code implemented

## Required Apple Developer Setup

### 1. Apple Developer Account
- Enroll in Apple Developer Program at developer.apple.com
- Cost: $99/year
- Provides access to App Store Connect and TestFlight

### 2. App Store Connect Setup
- Create new app in App Store Connect
- Configure bundle ID: `com.tracklit.app`
- Set up app metadata and screenshots

### 3. Local Build Process
```bash
# Download project from Replit
# Extract tracklit-native folder
cd tracklit-native

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Login to EAS with Apple ID
npx eas login

# Configure Apple Developer credentials in eas.json
# Replace YOUR_APPLE_ID_HERE with actual Apple ID
# Replace YOUR_APP_STORE_CONNECT_ID_HERE with actual App Store Connect ID

# Build for TestFlight
npx eas build --platform ios --profile testflight

# Submit to App Store Connect
npx eas submit --platform ios --profile production
```

## Alternative: Use Existing Apple Developer Account

If you already have an Apple Developer account:
1. Download the tracklit-native folder
2. Update `eas.json` with your Apple ID and App Store Connect ID
3. Run the build commands above

## Build Output
- **Build Time**: 20-30 minutes
- **Output**: `.ipa` file ready for TestFlight
- **Distribution**: Beta testing through TestFlight
- **Final Step**: Submit to App Store for review
